##  NXLOG vs WinLog Beats

It is possible to use this with NXLOG but you would need to convert the NXLOG event fields to the Beats equivalents.

For example EventID (NXLOG) vs event_id (WinLogBeats)

For other event fields they are prefixed with event_data_(Name), such as event_data_TargetUserName, so you would need to adjust all event field names to match Beats.
